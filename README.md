Scop
==

Scop is a story organization tool for authors. It provides hierarchical note management, rich character descriptions, and a timeline feature.

## Installation

Scop is available at <website>, and can optionally be installed as a Progressive Web App for offline use.

## Data

Your data is stored locally in the browser, and can be exported to a plain JSON file that can be imported later (or on a different device).

To prevent data loss and enable automatic synchronization between different devices, you can optionally connect to a Google Drive account.

## Roadmap

Scop is currently in early development. Most features are unimplemented, or unstable.

No release date is currently set for v1.0 of Scop. It will be released when it's ready.
